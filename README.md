This is the source code for the web app "Midterms 2018: Does My Congress Rep Support Obamacare?"

Since healthcare reform was a major issue during the 2018 midterm elections, I created this app so users can see how many people are uninsured in their congressional district yet qualifies for the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare. The aim is to highlight the number of people who could benefit from ACA but are not covered. 

## Methodology ##

Data for the uninsured was obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau, while converting the geographical units known as PUMA to congressional districts at the time were done using crosswalks from the Missouri Census Data Center. Users can find their representative by typing in their address thanks to the Google Civic Information API.
